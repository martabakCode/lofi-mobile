1. Ensure every component is reusable: All components should be designed to be reusable across the application, promoting modular development and reducing redundancy.
2. Ensure the project adheres to SOLID principles: The project must follow SOLID principles, which include:
2.1 Single Responsibility: Each class should have only one reason to change, focusing on a single task.
2.2 Open/Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
2.3 Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
2.4 Interface Segregation: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
2.5 Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
3. Ensure the project uses the MVVM design pattern: The application should implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern to separate the user interface from the business logic, enhancing maintainability and testability.
4. Ensure the project is offline-first: The application should prioritize offline functionality, allowing users to access and interact with data without requiring an internet connection.
5. Ensure the project integrates with Firebase for push notifications: The application must be integrated with Firebase to enable push notifications, allowing for real-time updates and improved user engagement.
6. Ensure the application is responsive on tablets: The user interface should adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, particularly tablets. This involves using flexible layouts, scalable UI components, and ensuring that content is well-distributed and visually appealing across larger screens. The design should leverage the increased real estate offered by tablets to enhance usability, making navigation and interaction intuitive and efficient.
Apple Design Rules
7. Focus on clarity: Ensure that the user interface is easy to understand, and every element serves a clear purpose. Use appropriate typography and spacing to enhance readability.
8. Emphasize deference: Design should prioritize content, allowing users to focus on what matters most. Interface elements should not overshadow the content.
9. Encourage depth: Use visual layers and realistic motion to create a sense of depth in the user interface. This helps users understand the hierarchy of information and actions.
10. Utilize intuitive gestures: Incorporate familiar gestures that align with user expectations on Apple devices, making interactions feel natural and intuitive.
11. Ensure consistent navigation: Maintain a consistent navigation model throughout the application, allowing users to easily understand how to navigate between different views and functionalities.
12. Adopt adaptive layouts: Design the application to work seamlessly across different device sizes and orientations, ensuring a great user experience on all Apple devices.
13. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This includes using appropriate color contrast, text sizing, and support for VoiceOver.
